# SafeCloset ${version}

SafeCloset is written by Denys SÃ©guret. Source code and documentation can be found on *https://github.com/Canop/safecloset*

SafeCloset stores secrets in drawers. A drawer may be either top-level, or hidden in another drawer. Each drawer is protected by a passphrase.

SafeCloset leaves after 60 seconds of inactivity.

## Keyboard actions

The *^* symbol in SafeCloset means that the *control* key must be pressed.

## Guarantees

There's none. And I can do nothing for you if you forget your passphrase.
