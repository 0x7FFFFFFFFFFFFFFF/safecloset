# Storage format

The storage format is described to ensure it's possible to replace SafeCloset with another software if needed.

The closet file is a [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) encoded structure `Closet` with the following fields:

* `comments`: a string
* `salt`: a string
* `drawers`: an array of `ClosedDrawer`

The MessagePack serialization preserves field names and allows future additions.

An instance of `ClosedDrawer` is a structure with the following fields:

* `id`: a byte array
* `nonce`: a byte array
* `content`: a byte array

The `content` is the AES-GCM-SIV encryption of the serialized drawer with the included `nonce`.
The key used for this encryption is a 256 bits Argon2 hash of the password with the closet's salt.

The serialized drawer is a MessagePack encoded structure with the following fields:

* `id`: a byte array
* `entries`: an array of `Entry`
* `settings`: an instance of `DrawerSettings`
* `closet`: a deeper closet, containing drawers, etc.
* `garbage`: a random byte array

Instances of `Entry` contain the following fields:

* `name`: a string
* `value`: a string

Instances of `DrawerSettings` contain the following fields:

* `hide_values`: a boolean
* `open_all_values`: a boolean (optional, false if not present)
